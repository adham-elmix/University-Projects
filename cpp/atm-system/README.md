# ATM System – C++

## Project Overview
This project is a simple ATM system implemented in C++ as part of my programming learning journey during university studies.

The goal of this project is to apply core programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and basic input validation.

## Features
- User authentication using PIN
- Balance inquiry
- Cash withdrawal with balance validation
- Deposit functionality
- Menu-driven console interface
- Error handling for invalid inputs

## Technologies Used
- C++
- Console-based application
- Standard C++ libraries

## What I Learned
- Structuring a C++ program properly
- Using functions to organize logic
- Handling user input safely
- Implementing simple real-world logic in code
- Improving problem-solving skills

## Challenges Faced
- Validating user input correctly
- Preventing invalid operations (e.g., withdrawing more than balance)
- Designing a clean and understandable menu system

## How I Solved Them
- Added input checks before processing operations
- Used conditional logic to handle edge cases
- Refactored code to improve readability

## Project Purpose
This project is part of my continuous learning journey in programming, focusing on C++ as one of the core languages in my Cyber Security academic track.

## Future Improvements
- File-based data storage
- Multiple user accounts
- Improved error handling
- Object-Oriented implementation
